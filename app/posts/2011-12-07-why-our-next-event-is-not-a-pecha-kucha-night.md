title: "Why our next event is not a Pecha Kucha night"
---

![](images/stories/brand.jpg)We originally programmed our monthly[ event for Januari ](en/meetings/details/42-een-avond-met-inhoud)to be a Pecha Kucha night.&nbsp;The Pecha Kucha format is real simple: a presentation of 20 slides that are shown 20 seconds each.

I'm sure our community does not want the same type of event over and over, so we think it's good to experiment with different formats, and this one looked like an interesting way to share a lot of ideas in a single meetup.&nbsp;

After anouncing the event we got an email from the folks of [golfstromen.nl](http://golfstromen.nl), who are 'curator' for this format in Amsterdam. They asked us to _get off their lawn!_

Yes, we think it is a bit sad, and it is just a format, but it is trademarked and you can only use the name after explicit consent from [the PechaKucha foundation](http://pecha-kucha.org).

So, there you have it. Where in our industry we have to deal with certification and patent trolls, in the 'creative' sector practices are not much better. A sad state of affairs. I'm off now investigating the potential for trademarking Blog, Podcast, Meetup, Website and Community.

For the meeting we'll think of a different format, but not too much. We think it's better to focus on creating and delivering great content, don't you agree?
