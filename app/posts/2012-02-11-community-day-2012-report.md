Devnology&rsquo;s third Community Day took place at [Vx Company](http://www.vxcompany.com/) in Baarn, in the best-furnished basement I ever visited. The community day is like a [one-day conference](nl/bijeenkomsten/details/43-community-day-2012) with blocks of time carved out for different sessions and workshops; I&rsquo;m only human and have not experienced them all, so I just picked the ones I was a part of.

## You shall not pass

Not exactly an activity, but it is becoming a tradition for the Community Day: upon arrival, we find closed gates. After some 45 minutes, a security guard shows up, and once inside, things start heating up. Literally: it was roughly -15 C outside, with blue skies and some sunshine, making it not all that unpleasant. I have never skied, but I imagine this is what apres ski feels like.

## Cloud9, or, why do I install all of this stuff

[Mike de Boer](https://twitter.com/mikedeboer) is a developer at Cloud9, and gave a very nice introductory talk into the way Cloud9&nbsp;&ldquo;is to Eclipse as Google Docs is to MSOffice&rdquo;.

I liked the way he walked us through the various features and advantages of Cloud9, but I would have liked a more developer-oriented pitch. We were shown a quick demo of debugging and live changes, but nothing showed up that made me go &ldquo;wow, time to ditch IntelliJ, Eclipse and TextMate at the same time!&rdquo;

## To inifinity, and beyond!

Never too shabby to take an engineer out of his comfort zone, into the land of mathematics, [Felienne Hermans](https://twitter.com/felienne) flipcharted her way from ancient Greece&rsquo;s Zeno&rsquo;s Paradox through the more modern notion of Hilbert&rsquo;s Hotel. Felt a bit like infinity-related excerpts from [The Clockwork Universe](http://www.amazon.com/Clockwork-Universe-Newton-Society-ebook/dp/B004GB1TTA), all compressed into roughly an hour. Also, I&rsquo;m very charmed by the let&rsquo;s-have-a-flipchart-and-start-talking way of presenting.

On a slightly less related note, it was her birthday!

## Clojurescript

[Martin van Amersfoort ](https://twitter.com/mamersfo)led a 150-minute workshop on Clojurescript. What I really liked is the way he built up the workshop, starting at the language level, getting the tools set up, and slowly moving up to the actual subject, running Clojure on top of JavaScript.

What I didn&rsquo;t like so much is that there was too much material for the reserved timeslot; probably a day&rsquo;s worth of material paraded by in some two hours, barely leaving time for hands-on Clojuring. I hope Martin finds the time reduce the amount of material (to, let&rsquo;s say an afternoon), then I&rsquo;ll be first in line again!

## A programming language is a language too, right?

My day ended with [Michel Rijnders](https://twitter.com/mrijn) doing some storytelling on how he started out as a philosopher by trade, and recently stumbled onto his books on the philosophy of language. There surely should be a link between human language and programming, right?

Well, no. As Michel expertly showed, even though human language is all about conveying meaning and alluding to another person&rsquo;s mental model of the world, the link to programming is pretty slim. Since in science there is no such thing as a failed experiment, I enjoyed this deviation from our usual programming-the-world view.

It later dawned on me that there may perhaps be more of a link between programming and classic poetry: both force you to take your ideas, and fit them into a strict harness. Any thoughts on that, Michel?

###### About the photos: you may know my photo gear is pretty retro, and I usually touch up the most annoying artifacts after scanning. This time, the weather (condensation along the bottom of the film strip) and the processing laboratory (numerous slanted, almost horizontal scratches) got the better of me.
