![](http://devnology.nl/images/stories/change.jpg)Such a great phrase, ' moving forward', particularly popular among company spin doctors who want to mask unfortunate events. Don't worry, all is well in Devnology land, however we are going through some changes that we wanted to share here.

So the bad news is yes, it's true there is no meeting planned in april. We tried to get The Original RAD Race organised, but it's proved to be more difficult than anticipated, and we've had put it on the backburner for now.

The good news is that we have restructured our sponsoring structure so that we now have three Gold sponsors.[ Finalist](http://www.finalist.nl) has hosted several Devnology meetings in the past and are commited to creating and sharing software development knowledge, so it's a great match for our community. The guys from [QWAN](http://www.qwan.it) are ofcourse well-known in our community, having participated in and facitlitated various sessions and workshops, so we're very pleased to have them on board. Our third sponsor is[ Macaw](http://www.macaw.nl/), who are also very committed to community events with a strong presence in Microsoft communities.

We'd like to thank[ VXCompany](http://www.vxcompany.com/) for sponsoring our efforts for the last three years, they have enabled us to move from just an idea to the vibrant community that is Devnology today. Couldn't have done it without you guys!

Last, but not least, we're happy to welcome a new member to the Devnology board. From now on Felienne Hermans will help us in our effort to bring you even more software developer events that will be interactive, language- and platform independent and FUN!
