title: "Report Learn a language : LISP"
---

On the 5th of September Devnology community members gathered at the [Mirabeau ](http://www.mirabeau.nl/)offices in Amsterdam to study the ways of LISP.

[Carlo Sciolla](http://twitter.com/skuro) was on hand to explain how the new incarnation of this language Clojure is gaining interest and how the [Amsterdam Clojure meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/The-Amsterdam-Clojure-Meetup-Group/) regularly host events around it.

Then [Tijs van der Storm](http://twitter.com/tvdstorm) was kind enough to lead us through some of the concepts and the history of Lisp and its many dialects.

After this introduction it was hands to the keyboard to try out how to fit as many parentheses as possible on the screen. A fun night of learning and hacking!
