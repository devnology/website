title: "Kids Programming Lego Mindstorms"
---

On Saturday the 1st of June we organised a Kids Programming day. Several coder dads had brought their offspring to get a taste of coding a Lego Mindstorms robot using different assignments from the First Lego League (FLL). The event was hosted by [Q42](http://q42.nl) in their real nice offices in Den Haag. For most kids it was their first foray into programming but by the end of the day several assignments where completed succesfully.
The pictures and video below give a nice impression of this fun day.
