title: "Report Devnology weekend 2013"
---

In sept 2013 we had the by now yearly Devnology weekend outing, this time in the lovely countryside around Groesbeek. With a lot of familiair faces and a few new ones we all had a great time, starting with an improv theater workshop on friday, courtesy of our generous sponsor [ Codewise](http://codewise.nl/). Fun was had coding in some new environment or language, playing with (and programming) a [drone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/), and [coding a turing machine in Excel.](http://www.felienne.com/?p=2974)
