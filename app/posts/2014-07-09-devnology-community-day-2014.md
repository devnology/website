It's been a while since we've done one of these, we have been busy organising our monthly meetings and ofcourse the [Joy of Coding ](http://JoyOfCoding.org)conference. However, we felt it was time and are excited to announce the fourth Devnology Community Day!

It will take place on the 4th of October at the offices of[ AFAS Software](http://www.afas.nl) in Leusden.

To get an idea of the type of event this is, read some of the experience reports of previous editions [here](nl/blog/7-verslagen/212-review-community-day-2012), [here](nl/blog/7-verslagen/209-community-day-2012-report), [here ](nl/blog/7-verslagen/141-verslag-community-day-2010)or [here](nl/blog/7-verslagen/140-community-day-2010-socializen-kennisslurpen-en-antischaap). Or look through some of the photos on our[ Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/devnology/sets/).

This day is for sharing with our community some of the things that you have learned or find interesting.&nbsp;

See you on the 4th of October!
